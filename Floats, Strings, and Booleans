/*Floating Point Types
Floating Point Types are also specified by their bit-size BUT, an increase in bit width equates to an increase in precision, NOT range.*/

/*Two Floating Point Types in Go:
  Float32 and Float64; Use float64 as a general purpose float*/
/*Also two complex number types:
  Complex64 and Complex128*/

/*Strings: Are arrays of bytes or runes; in other words, a collection of characters held within a container to be used for different purposes.
 >Can be enclosed with either '' or ""
 >Back-ticked ('') strings can contain new lines
 >Double qouted strings can contain special chars like \n (new line) or \t (tab)
 >Strings can be indexed: "Go"[1] will return 111, the ASCII code of the letter "o" in "Go" remember - indexes start at [0], asking for [1] is really asking for 2nd char 'properties'
 >The first index of a  string is 0 (All arrays in Go-Lang are zero-based.)*/

 /*Booleans: True or False evaluation.
 >True and False are defined.
 >There are 3 boolean operators: && (and), || (or), and ! (not).
 >All relational operators return true or false (a boolean).
 >Relational Operators include: == (is equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to)*/
